                Spring is coming, and it's time for the annual toothpick bridge competition. Don't watch your bridges
                collapse! Instead come to Maxwell Scientific for high-quality materials and adhesives. Maxwell
                Scientific also provides educational material to teach basic engineering principles and help your
                students design the best structures. When it comes time to put those bridges to the test, look towards
                Maxwell Scientific for precision structure testers.
